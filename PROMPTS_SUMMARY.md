- **Project initialization:** User requested help creating a software project outline, Claude asked clarifying questions about project type, purpose, stage, and detail level
- **Requirements gathering:** User specified building a receipt/invoice data extractor web app for small businesses using PHP/Laravel, React, TailwindCSS, and SQLite with a 16-hour development timeline
- **Initial outline creation:** Claude generated a comprehensive 397-line PROJECT_OUTLINE.md including tech stack, database schema, API endpoints, 16-hour timeline breakdown, and MVP scope
- **User refinements:** User updated the outline to specify Claude API (instead of generic AI-powered OCR), added API versioning (/api/v1/), included detailed prompt template with sample JSON, and moved Excel export and data editing to must-have MVP features
- **Docker integration:** User requested Docker containerization be added to the project; Claude updated the outline to include Dockerfile configurations, docker-compose.yml orchestration, and volume mounts for persistent data
- **Implementation phase:** Session moved from planning to active development/troubleshooting
- **Image display bug:** Encountered issue where receipt images weren't displaying on the detail page, showing "Route [login] not defined" error when accessed directly
- **Root cause identified:** Direct browser requests to image URLs couldn't include authentication headers, causing Laravel authentication middleware to fail
- **Solution implemented:** Created blob-based image fetching system using axios with authentication, including state management for loading/error states and proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Final result:** Receipt images now load correctly with authentication while maintaining security requirements
